Welcome to Cydia Cleaner!

This little Python program was written to help clean up the Cydia repos on a jailbroken iPhone. This program ignores the "Entered by User" repos, but checks the "Installed By Package" repos.

I decided to write this due to the "All Sources" package routinely giving me bunk repos that I would have to remove using either SSH or MobileTerminal. Cydia does not allow removal of repos that are installed by packages for whatever reason, and removing the "All Sources" app even states that removing the app does not remove the sources it installs.

Currently, this is a script you upload and run directly on your phone (any directory is fine, so long as you're root). When it's run by itself, it checks your repos, then if any bad repos are found, it "retires" it from your repos.

After it has 'retired' any faulty repos, it then re-checks any previously retired repos (but not the ones it has retired in that session) and, if found to be valid, are 'revived' and placed back into your repo list.
