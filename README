Welcome to Cydia Cleaner!

This little Python program was written to help clean up the Cydia repos on a jailbroken iPhone by "retiring" bad or offline repos. It ignores the "Entered by User" repos and only checks those that are "Installed By Package".

I decided to write this due to the "All Sources" package routinely giving me bunk repos that I would have to remove using either SSH or MobileTerminal. Cydia does not allow removal of repos that are installed by packages for whatever reason, and removing the "All Sources" app even states that removing the app does not remove the sources it installs.

To use, simply put cydiacleaner.py on your phone and run it as root. When run, it checks your repos and if any bad repos are found, it "retires" them from your Cydia repos. Next, it re-checks any previously retired repos (but not the ones we just retired) and, if found to be valid, they are 'revived' and placed back into your Cydia repos.

Retired repo files are placed in the retired/ folder inside your sources folder.
